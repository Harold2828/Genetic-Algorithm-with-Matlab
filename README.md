# ðŸ§  MATLAB Genetic Algorithm for Hybrid Energy System Optimization

This repository provides a **MATLAB-based simulation and optimization tool** that uses a **Genetic Algorithm (GA)** to determine the optimal configuration of a hybrid energy system. The system includes solar panels, wind turbines, batteries, and diesel generators, designed to meet dynamic hourly energy demand while minimizing the **Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE)**.
